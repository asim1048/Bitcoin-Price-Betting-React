## How to run locally

This is the React client for the sample and runs independently of the server.
Running a backend server is a requirement and a dependency for this React front-end to work. See the README in the root of the project for more details.

To run the React client locally:

1. Install dependencies

From this directory run:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start the react app

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the react server running on localhost:3000.
